## Introduction

In response to an internship application task, this project showcases how to automate the testing of specific fields on a web page using C# and Selenium. The goal is to ensure the program can adapt to changes in HTML element properties associated with the chosen fields.

## Requirements

To run the program, you need the following:

- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) installed.
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) installed and added to the system's PATH.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ajitesh72/CloudQA-selenium/tree/main
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
2. Modify the paths and configurations if necessary.
3. Build and run the program.
4. The program will navigate to the CloudQA Automation Practice Form and automate the testing of specific fields.


## Future Improvements

While the current program demonstrates the basic automated testing of fields, there are several ways to enhance it:

- Implement a more comprehensive test suite.
- Parameterize test data for more extensive testing scenarios.
- Utilize external configuration files for test data and settings.
- Implement error handling and reporting for failed tests.
- Explore parallel test execution for efficiency.
